# Foursquare WordPress Theme

*Please note this is in beta release and is still baking. More updates to come.*

This is a WordPress theme built by The Foursquare Church for local Foursquare churches to provide them with an out-of-the-box solution for creating a website. 

Special hat tip to the team at Twitter for creating [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap), a framework this theme relies on for its design and functionality.

## Installation & Basic Setup

This theme requires WordPress 3.0 or above. [Visit the WordPress website](http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress) for instructions on how to run WordPress

This repository includes all the theme files necessary to hit the ground running. To install, simply download the latest release and upload the ZIP file directly to your /wp-content/themes folder and select the theme from your WordPress dashboard (under Appearance > Themes). 

Please note that this theme relies on a few plugins for certain features to work properly and comes bundled with the files you need. You will be prompted to activate the plugins once the theme has been activated.

## Customizing the Appearance

This theme allows you to adjust the design and choose from several settings to tailor it to your needs. Log into your WordPress dashboard to customize your settings.

### Foursquare Theme Options  
Navigate to this tab to customize the following settings:

* Background (choose from a variety of different textures)
* Google Map (the map that is displayed on the homepage)
* Service Times (select the days and enter the times for each of your church services throughout the week)
* Google Analytics (enter your ID to easily integrate Google Analytics to your site)

### Homepage Slider
Access this tab to upload and edit as many images that you want to rotate on the homepage as you would like.

### Header
This theme supports the built-in WordPress header feature (under Appearance > Header) that allows you to upload a custom logo that displays at the top of the site. By default, your site's name will be displayed if no image is uploaded.
